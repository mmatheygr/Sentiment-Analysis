# Sentiment-Analysis
In December of 2022 I came across a well known Peruvian social magazine that had a list of most coveted bachelors. Out of curiosity, I read it and was shocked by the differences in the way women and men were described. To better understand them, I decided to apply a basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to build a word cloud and check the most used words by gender. As you will be able to read, the words used to describe men are related to professional success while those used to describe women are associated to topics traditionally considered as superficial. The takeaway for me is clear: it is crucial to question the way in which I refer to the success of people.
